Sudoku-Solver
=============
Client side javascript sudoku solver using dancing links. It was fun to write. It uses Canvas to draw the board,
which doesn't seem to work in Internet explorer, even the latest version.

sudoku.js is the solver back end.
sudoku_ui.js is the front end.
sudoku.html is the page definition.
style.css is the stylesheet.


Todo: show a warning when no solution was found, but the error is not immediately obvious to the front end. is it possible to point out what causes the conflict?
